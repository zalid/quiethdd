quietHDD modifies the APM and AAM settings of Harddrives on startup, suspend, hibernate and tries to reduce noise. It is designed to work on Windows XP and above.

The APM/AAM settings of an hard disk are lost on every wakeup event from suspend or hibernate. With quietHDD you can choose your own values for those settings and let them set again on every system startup, on every wakeup event from suspend or hibernate.

The main advantage of quietHDD is the small size, it does not consumes any unnecessary CPU power and it designed to be simple, small and effective. You may even disable it's tray icon if you want to.

quietHDD is loosely inspired by hdparm for Windows.
